## Semi Auto Annotator script 

### This is a POC script to automate the annotation process 

#### once the POC is done, we will make it more generic build GUI for it using Flutter



### this script is used to annotate the image using the trained model

### once the all images are annotated, the script will generate appropriate annotations in any format you want (YOLO, COCO, VOC, etc)


### then you can visualize the annotations and correct them if needed
